# Transforming Data with DuckDB and dbt

The DuckDB Foundation wrote an article titled ["Transforming Data with DuckDB and dbt"](https://duckdb.org/2025/04/04/dbt-duckdb.html). In it, they demonstrate how data can be processed with dbt and DuckDB. The relevant code is avaiable on [github](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-blog-examples/tree/main/dbt_duckdb).

This is an implementation of the code and approaches from that article.
